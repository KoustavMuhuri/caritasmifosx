Welcome to the Mifos community!
===============================

Depending on the OS you're running, you should have "runmifosx.sh" (for Linux and Mac) and
"runmifosx.bat" (for Windows) in this directory. These are small scripts that allow you to
run MifosX on your computer locally. To be able to run MifosX, just double-click on the script,
that is, "runmifosx.sh" if you are on Linux or Mac, or "runmifosx.bat" if you are on Windows.

If you have a web front-end that you want to use along with the backend server, put your index.html
along with all the other source files inside a (sub-folder of) the "apps" folder in the current
directory from where runmifosx.bat/.sh is launched.  The web UI front-end is then accessible
under mifosng-provider/apps - for example:

    https://localhost:8443/mifosng-provider/apps/community-app/index.html

We hope you'll have an amazing experience working with MifosX!


PS, internal note to Mifos developers preparing packages, only: For this to work, the WAR of
the Mifos X distribution ZIP package will (currently) have to be built using
the Gradle 'dev' environment profile - e.g. using this command:

    ./gradlew -Penv=dev clean war dist
